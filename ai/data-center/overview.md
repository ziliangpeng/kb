# Data Center Overview

A data center is a facility containing racks of servers. The number of racks is limited by total power budget and physical floor space. For AI workloads, power is typically the tighter constraint — at 100+ kW per rack, you run out of power before floor space.

Typical scale: a 1 GW data center might have ~10,000 racks with ~500K-1M GPUs total.
