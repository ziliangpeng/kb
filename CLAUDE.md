# Instructions

- Do not proactively write notes or documents. Always discuss ideas and technical details with the user first. Ensure the user has gone through all the information and understands it before writing anything to the knowledge base.
- When linking between documents, always use the full path relative to the vault root (e.g., `[[llm/original-transformer-architecture]]` instead of `[[original-transformer-architecture]]`) to avoid ambiguity.
