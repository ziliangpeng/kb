# OpenAI Personnel History

A comprehensive timeline of key personnel changes at OpenAI from founding (2015) through present.

## Founding Team (December 2015)

OpenAI was announced on December 11, 2015 as a nonprofit AI research lab with $1 billion in pledged funding.

**Co-Chairs:**

- **Sam Altman** — President of Y Combinator
- **Elon Musk** — CEO of Tesla and SpaceX

**Research Director:**

- **Ilya Sutskever** — Recruited from Google Brain, student of Geoffrey Hinton. Led research from day one.

**CTO:**

- **Greg Brockman** — Former CTO of Stripe. Recruited the founding team.

**Founding Research Team (first 9 employees):**

- **Andrej Karpathy** — PhD from Stanford (under Fei-Fei Li)
- **John Schulman** — Reinforcement learning expert, co-inventor of PPO
- **Wojciech Zaremba** — Deep learning researcher
- **Durk Kingma** — Creator of the VAE and Adam optimizer
- **Vicki Cheung** — Software engineer
- **Pamela Vagata** — Engineer (left early ~2016, went to Stripe)
- **Trevor Blackwell** — Y Combinator partner, robotics

**Original Board:** Sam Altman (co-chair) and Elon Musk (co-chair). Expanded by ~2017 to include Holden Karnofsky (Open Philanthropy), later Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder) and Adam D'Angelo (Quora CEO).

## Early Departures and Key Hires (2016-2019)

### Departures

| Person | Role | Departed | Went To | Reason |
|--------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Pamela Vagata | Founding engineer | ~2016 | Stripe | Early departure |
| Trevor Blackwell | Founding member | ~2017 | — | Minimal involvement post-founding |
| Andrej Karpathy | Founding researcher | June 2017 | Tesla (Director of AI/Autopilot) | Recruited by Musk |
| Durk Kingma | Research scientist | 2018 | Google DeepMind | — |
| Elon Musk | Co-chair, board member | Feb 2018 | Remained as donor | See below |

### Elon Musk's Departure (February 2018)

Musk resigned from the board in February 2018. The official reason was "potential future conflict of interest" with Tesla's growing AI work. The real story:

- Musk proposed that OpenAI either **merge with Tesla** or that he take **majority control** (majority stake + board control)
- Altman and Brockman rejected this
- Musk told the team their "probability of success was 0" and said he planned to build AGI at Tesla instead
- Ironically, Musk himself had earlier pushed for OpenAI to become for-profit, emailing in 2018 that OpenAI "needs billions per year immediately" to compete with Google

Musk continued to donate but became increasingly critical, eventually suing OpenAI in 2024 and launching xAI as a competitor.

### The Capped-Profit Transition (March 2019)

OpenAI created **OpenAI LP**, a "capped-profit" subsidiary controlled by the nonprofit:

- Investors' returns capped at **100x** their investment; nonprofit board retained control
- Driven by **Sam Altman**, arguing that OpenAI's ambitions exceeded what donations could support
- Enabled the **$1 billion Microsoft investment** (July 2019)
- This became the seed of tension that would later cause the Anthropic exodus — safety-focused researchers worried about "industrial capture"

### Key Hires

- **Bob McGrew** — Joined 2017, promoted to VP of Research (2018), later Chief Research Officer
- **Mira Murati** — Joined ~2018 from Tesla (worked on Model X), eventually became CTO (May 2022)
- **Jakub Pachocki** — Joined 2017, worked on Dota 2 AI, eventually became Chief Scientist (2024)
- **Jerry Tworek** — Joined ~2018, rose to VP of Research, led reasoning model work (o1, o3)
- **Lilian Weng** — Joined ~2018, became VP of Research and Safety

## The Anthropic Exodus (2020-2021)

The single largest brain drain in OpenAI's history.

**Timeline:**

- **December 2020**: Dario Amodei (VP of Research) departs
- **January 2021**: Anthropic formally founded
- **Early-mid 2021**: ~14 additional researchers follow

### The Seven Anthropic Co-Founders (All Ex-OpenAI)

| Person | Role at OpenAI | Role at Anthropic |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Dario Amodei | VP of Research | CEO |
| Daniela Amodei | VP of Operations | President |
| Tom Brown | Lead author of GPT-3 paper | Co-founder |
| Jack Clark | Policy Director | Head of Policy |
| Jared Kaplan | Researcher (scaling laws pioneer) | Chief Science Officer |
| Sam McCandlish | Researcher | Chief Architect / CTO |
| Chris Olah | Interpretability researcher (founded Distill.pub) | Interpretability Lead |

### Why They Left

1. **Safety concerns**: The $1B Microsoft investment and increasing commercial pressure worried safety-focused researchers. They feared "industrial capture" of OpenAI.
2. **Vision differences**: Dario Amodei said: "It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision, so I decided to take some people you trust and go make your vision happen."
3. **Commercialization vs. research**: The group wanted a company that would prioritize safety research ("Constitutional AI") over product shipping.

### Impact

Devastating for OpenAI's research bench:

- **Tom Brown** was the lead author on the GPT-3 paper
- **Jared Kaplan** pioneered the scaling laws that shaped the entire field
- **Chris Olah** was one of the world's top interpretability researchers

However, OpenAI retained Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, Greg Brockman, and the infrastructure team.

## Pre-ChatGPT Era (2021-2022)

A relatively quiet period for personnel. The big events were products shipping:

- **DALL-E** (January 2021) — text-to-image
- **Codex** (August 2021) — code generation, powers GitHub Copilot
- **DALL-E 2** (April 2022)
- **ChatGPT** (November 30, 2022) — 100 million users in 2 months

**Key moves:**

- **Mira Murati** promoted to **CTO** (May 2022) — overseeing ChatGPT, DALL-E, Codex, and later Sora
- **Barret Zoph** joined from Google Brain (2022) as VP of Research
- Ilya Sutskever increasingly focused on alignment/safety
- Headcount grew from ~375 (late 2022) toward 1,000+

**Board composition (~2022):** Sam Altman, Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, Ilya Sutskever. Reid Hoffman stepped down in 2023 due to conflicts (invested in competing AI companies).

## The Sam Altman Firing Crisis (November 2023)

The most dramatic corporate governance crisis in recent tech history.

### The Board That Fired Altman

1. **Ilya Sutskever** — Chief Scientist, co-founder
2. **Adam D'Angelo** — CEO of Quora
3. **Tasha McCauley** — Entrepreneur, roboticist
4. **Helen Toner** — Director of Strategy at Georgetown's CSET

### Day-by-Day Timeline

**November 16-17 (Thursday-Friday):**

- Board votes to fire Altman. Stated reason: "He was not consistently candid in his communications with the board."
- Mira Murati named interim CEO
- Greg Brockman removed as board chair, subsequently resigns entirely
- The firing caught investors (including Microsoft) by surprise

**November 18-19 (Saturday-Sunday):**

- Negotiations to reinstate Altman fail
- Board hires **Emmett Shear** (former Twitch CEO) as interim CEO, replacing Murati after just 2 days
- Satya Nadella announces Altman and Brockman will join Microsoft to lead a new "advanced AI research" team

**November 20 (Monday):**

- **~730 of ~770 employees** sign an open letter demanding the board resign and Altman be reinstated, threatening to follow him to Microsoft
- **Ilya Sutskever reverses course**: "I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions."

**November 22 (Wednesday):**

- Altman reinstated as CEO
- **New interim board**: Bret Taylor (chair, former Salesforce co-CEO), Larry Summers (former Treasury Secretary), Adam D'Angelo (only holdover)
- Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner removed. Ilya Sutskever removed from the board.

### What It Exposed

The safety-oriented board members (nonprofit governance) lost decisively to commercial momentum. 730 out of 770 employees siding with Altman proved that OpenAI had already become a product company in culture, regardless of its nonprofit shell.

## The 2024 Great Exodus

The biggest wave of senior departures since the Anthropic exodus — spread across the whole year, hitting safety roles especially hard.

### February 2024

- **Andrej Karpathy** — Left for the second time. Said "no drama," wanted to pursue personal projects. Later founded **Eureka Labs** (AI education startup).

### April-May 2024: Safety Team Collapse

- **Leopold Aschenbrenner** — Superalignment team member. **Fired** in April for allegedly leaking to journalists. Claimed he was fired for raising safety concerns to the board. Later published the influential "Situational Awareness" essay.
- **Daniel Kokotajlo** — Governance researcher, quit April. Said: "I gradually lost trust in OpenAI leadership and their ability to responsibly handle AGI." **Refused to sign non-disparagement agreement, forfeiting significant equity.**
- **William Saunders** — Safety researcher, also quit and refused non-disparagement, forfeiting equity.
- **Ilya Sutskever** — Resigned May. Founded **Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)** in June with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy. SSI raised $1B (Sep 2024), then $2B more (Mar 2025), reaching ~$32B valuation.
- **Jan Leike** — Co-lead of Superalignment team (with Sutskever). Resigned May. Publicly stated OpenAI's **"safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products."** Joined Anthropic.
- OpenAI **disbanded the Superalignment team** after Sutskever and Leike left.

### The Equity Clawback Controversy (May 2024)

The departures exposed that OpenAI used aggressive non-disparagement agreements threatening to **claw back vested equity** from departing employees who spoke critically. Altman claimed he was unaware of these provisions, but leaked documents showed leadership had signed off on the clawback terms. OpenAI subsequently removed these clauses. This is why Kokotajlo and Saunders forfeiting equity was notable — they chose to speak freely at enormous personal cost.

### August 2024

- **John Schulman** — Co-founder, creator of PPO, led the RL/RLHF work that made ChatGPT possible. Left for **Anthropic** to focus on alignment. (Left Anthropic in February 2025 after less than a year.)
- **Greg Brockman** — Took an extended leave of absence (returned later).

By August 2024, roughly **half of the ~30 staffers working on AGI safety** had left.

### September 25, 2024: The "Triple Departure"

Three senior leaders departed on the same day:

- **Mira Murati** — CTO since 2022, interim CEO during the firing crisis. Founded **Thinking Machines Lab** (Feb 2025), raised $2B at $12B valuation, in talks for $50B by late 2025.
- **Bob McGrew** — Chief Research Officer (at OpenAI since 2017).
- **Barret Zoph** — VP of Research. Co-founded Thinking Machines Lab with Murati. Later returned to OpenAI in January 2026.

Altman claimed the three made their decisions "independently."

### October-November 2024

- **Miles Brundage** — Senior Advisor for AGI Readiness, 6+ years. His team was disbanded.
- **Lilian Weng** — VP of Research and Safety, 7 years. Co-founded Thinking Machines Lab.
- **Richard Ngo** — AI governance researcher.

### New Leadership (2024)

- **Jakub Pachocki** → Chief Scientist (May, replacing Sutskever)
- **Mark Chen** → SVP of Research
- New board members (March): Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Nicole Seligman, Fidji Simo. Sam Altman rejoined the board.

## 2025 Departures

- **Liam Fedus** — VP of Research (post-training), left March. Co-founded **Periodic Labs**.
- **Julia Villagra** — Chief People Officer, resigned August (just promoted months earlier).
- **Hannah Wong** — Chief Communications Officer, departed December.
- **Larry Summers** — Stepped down from board November, following controversy over archived Epstein emails.
- **Aleksander Madry** — Head of Preparedness, reassigned from safety leadership to AI reasoning role.

**Meta's raid:** Meta's **Superintelligence Lab** (led by Zuckerberg) aggressively recruited from OpenAI, reportedly offering **nine-figure signing bonuses**. Over 20 OpenAI employees moved to Meta.

**Jerry Tworek (January 2026):** VP of Research, 7 years. Central to ChatGPT, early Codex, and the o1/o3 reasoning models. Departed citing a desire to explore "types of research that are hard to do at OpenAI" — widely interpreted as criticism of OpenAI's product-heavy direction.

## The Hiring Offensive (Mid-2025 — Early 2026)

After the 2024 exodus, OpenAI went on an aggressive hiring and acquisition spree.

### From xAI

Half of xAI's 12-person founding team departed by February 2026. Several went to OpenAI:

- **Uday Ruddarraju** — Head of infrastructure engineering at xAI, oversaw Grok 3 training across 100K GPUs. Major infrastructure hire.
- **Mike Dalton** — Infrastructure engineer, hired alongside Ruddarraju.
- **Mike Liberatore** — CFO of xAI (served only ~4 months). Joined as Business Finance Officer for AI Infrastructure.
- **Xuechen Li** — Grok team engineer. xAI sued him for allegedly downloading their entire codebase before leaving. FBI executed search warrants. Federal criminal investigation ongoing.
- **Jimmy Fraiture** — Led xAI's production inference team. Also named in the xAI lawsuit for allegedly AirDropping source files to personal devices.

The broader xAI collapse accelerated after xAI's merger with SpaceX in early February 2026.

### Returns to OpenAI

- **Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, Sam Schoenholz** — All returned from Thinking Machines Lab (January 2026). Zoph was the CTO there. Murati announced they "parted ways," and **58 minutes later** OpenAI announced the hires. Major blow to Thinking Machines Lab — losing two co-founders less than a year after a $2B raise.

### Senior Hires

| Name | From | New Role at OpenAI | When |
|------|------|-------------------|------|
| Fidji Simo | CEO of Instacart | CEO of Applications (new role) | May 2025 |
| Denise Dresser | CEO of Slack | Chief Revenue Officer (first ever) | Dec 2025 |
| Albert Lee | VP Corporate Development at Google ($50B+ in M&A) | VP Corporate Development | Dec 2025 |
| Dylan Scandinaro | AI safety team at Anthropic | Head of Preparedness ($555K base) | Feb 2026 |

### Acquisitions and Acqui-Hires

At least **9 acquisitions in one year**:

- **io (Jony Ive's company)** — $6.5B all-equity deal (May 2025). ~55 employees joined, many former Apple designers. Triggered a wave of Apple departures with $1M+ stock grants.
- **Cline** (coding startup) — Hired at least 7 engineers to work on Codex (not a formal acquisition).
- **Torch** (health records, 4-person team) — $60-100M to expand ChatGPT Health.
- Smaller acqui-hires: Roi, Context.ai, Crossing Minds, Alex, Convogo.

### Retention Efforts

- One-time bonuses worth millions to key staff (August 2025)
- Eliminated the 6-month equity vesting cliff
- Average stock packages of **$1.5M** for new hires

## Board Composition Over Time

| Period | Board Members |
|--------|--------------|
| Dec 2015 | Sam Altman (co-chair), Elon Musk (co-chair) |
| ~2017 | + Holden Karnofsky |
| ~2018 | - Elon Musk; + Reid Hoffman, + others |
| Pre-crisis 2023 | Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner |
| Nov 22, 2023 (post-crisis) | Bret Taylor (chair), Larry Summers, Adam D'Angelo |
| March 2024 | + Sam Altman, + Sue Desmond-Hellmann, + Nicole Seligman, + Fidji Simo |
| Late 2025 | Bret Taylor (chair), Adam D'Angelo, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Zico Kolter, Paul Nakasone, Adebayo Ogunlesi, Nicole Seligman, Sam Altman. (- Larry Summers, - Fidji Simo) |

## Corporate Structure Transitions

### Phase 1: Nonprofit (2015-2019)

Pure nonprofit. Open research, publishing papers freely. The "open" in OpenAI was meaningful.

### Phase 2: Capped-Profit (March 2019)

Created OpenAI LP. Investors' returns capped at 100x. Nonprofit retained full control. Enabled the Microsoft investment.

### Phase 3: For-Profit Attempt (December 2024)

OpenAI announced plans for the nonprofit to hold only a minority stake. Faced backlash from Elon Musk (lawsuit), California AG, and others.

### Phase 4: Public Benefit Corporation (October 2025)

OpenAI abandoned full for-profit conversion (May 2025) after backlash. Instead converted to **OpenAI Group PBC** (Public Benefit Corporation):

- The OpenAI Foundation (nonprofit) retains control and holds a ~$130B equity stake
- A PBC must balance financial returns with a stated public mission
- California and Delaware AGs approved with conditions
