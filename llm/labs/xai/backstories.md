# xAI Backstories

Narrative and contextual stories behind xAI — talent dynamics, culture, corporate entanglements, and controversies.

## Talent Retention

xAI has a significant retention problem, with departures heavily skewed toward OpenAI:

**Co-founders who left:**

- **Kyle Kosic** (Apr 2024) → returned to OpenAI
- **Christian Szegedy** (Feb 2025) → Morph (AI code startup), "difference in research direction"
- **Igor Babuschkin** (Aug 2025) → founded Babuschkin Ventures (AI safety VC), then poached by OpenAI. Musk thanked him: "xAI wouldn't be here without you."

**Key executives who left:**

- **Uday Ruddarraju** (Head of Infrastructure Engineering, Jul 2025) → OpenAI
- **Mike Liberatore** (CFO, Jul 2025, after only ~3 months) → OpenAI
- **Robert Keele** (General Counsel, Oct 2025) → Skydio
- **Linda Yaccarino** (CEO of X, Jul 2025) → resigned after xAI acquisition of X

## Culture

xAI operates with Musk's characteristic intensity:

- **Mandatory surveillance software**: In July 2025, xAI mandated employees install Hubstaff (tracks websites, apps, keystrokes, captures screenshots) on personal laptops. Partially reversed after backlash — company Chromebooks offered as alternative.
- **Sleeping tents** at the office (confirmed by employees, though "not that many out at once")
- **Cybertruck incentive**: Musk offered a free Cybertruck to an engineer who could get a GPU training run working in 24 hours. He succeeded.
- **Construction speed over permits**: xAI used carnival/temporary land agreements as "the fastest way to get permitting through" for Colossus
- **71-minute podcast incident**: Engineer Sulaiman Ghori gave a detailed podcast interview ("WTF is happening at xAI") revealing internal details. Departed 4 days later.

## The Oracle Arc

- **2023-2024**: xAI rented ~16,000 H100 GPUs from Oracle Cloud to train Grok-1 and Grok-2
- **Mid-2024**: Negotiated a **$10 billion** multi-year server rental deal with Oracle
- **xAI walked away**: Musk cited speed — "xAI's fundamental competitiveness depends on being faster than any other AI company." Built Colossus in 122 days instead.
- **June 2025**: Oracle pivoted to inference/distribution — Grok models now available on OCI for enterprise customers

## Tesla Entanglements

### GPU Diversion

In late 2023/early 2024, Musk ordered NVIDIA to redirect **12,000 H100 GPUs** (part of a $500M Tesla purchase) to X/xAI, delaying Tesla's delivery by months. Musk's defense: Tesla "had no place to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on." Shareholder lawsuit filed for breach of fiduciary duty. Internal NVIDIA emails confirmed the diversion.

### Tesla Investments in xAI

- Tesla invested **$2 billion** in xAI (disclosed Jan 2026)
- Tesla sold **$430 million** of Megapack batteries to xAI in 2025
- At least 11 employees moved from Tesla to xAI

### Tesla Dojo Shutdown

Tesla disbanded the Dojo team in **August 2025**. Musk called it "an evolutionary dead end." ~20 engineers left to found DensityAI. No direct technology transfer to xAI — Dojo was custom silicon (D1 chip), while Colossus uses commodity NVIDIA hardware.

## SpaceX Merger

**February 2, 2026**: SpaceX acquired xAI in an all-stock transaction — combined $1.25 trillion valuation ($1T SpaceX + $250B xAI). Largest merger in history. xAI's debt and legal exposure kept separate from SpaceX.

Musk's stated vision: "orbital data centers" powered by solar in space. SpaceX filed FCC application for 1 million satellites. CNBC's assessment: "Musk's xAI needs SpaceX deal for the money. Data centers in space are still a dream." The near-term motivation is clearly financial — accessing SpaceX IPO capital to fund xAI's infrastructure buildout.

## Safety Record

xAI has drawn significant criticism for its safety practices:

- Does not publish safety reports before deployment (unlike Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)
- **July 2025 incident**: An engagement optimization update ("don't shy away from politically incorrect claims") caused Grok to produce antisemitic and white nationalist content for ~16 hours. xAI issued an apology.
- AI Lab Watch described xAI's safety framework as "dreadful"
- Researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and academia publicly called xAI's safety culture "reckless"

## Environmental Controversy

Colossus is in a **historically Black, underserved neighborhood** in South Memphis. xAI installed **35 unpermitted methane gas turbines** (~421 MW capacity):

- Peak nitrogen dioxide levels increased **79%** near the facility
- Estimated **1,200-2,000 tons of NOx per year** — eclipsing Memphis airport emissions
- NAACP threatened lawsuit. Southern Environmental Law Center raised environmental racism concerns.
- **EPA updated rules** (Jan 2026) closing the "non-road engine" loophole xAI had used
- Shelby County eventually granted a permit for 15 turbines (~247 MW), valid through January 2027
