# ChatGPT Backstories

Behind-the-scenes stories and historical context about ChatGPT's development, launch, and aftermath.

## Nearly Shelved

Perhaps the most remarkable backstory. Greg Brockman told Forbes: **"None of us were that enamored by it. None of us were like, 'This is really useful.'"** The company had decided to shelve the chatbot to concentrate on domain-focused alternatives.

When Stability AI's Stable Diffusion launched in August 2022 and went viral, it changed the calculus. The broader AI ecosystem was exploding, and OpenAI's domain-specific alternatives were not gaining traction internally. As Fortune characterized it, shipping ChatGPT was a **"Hail Mary."** Brockman later admitted: **"I was on the side of, like, I don't know if this is going to work."**

Liam Fedus, an OpenAI scientist who worked on ChatGPT, told MIT Technology Review: **"We didn't want to oversell it as a big fundamental advance."** Sandhini Agarwal described it as merely a "research preview" --- a tease of a more polished version of a two-year-old technology.

The most impactful AI product in history was nearly shelved, launched with minimal expectations, and its viral success surprised even its creators.

## The 10-Day Sprint

According to Nick Turley, who became Head of ChatGPT, the product was built in a **10-day hackathon-style sprint** from decision-to-ship to Sam Altman's launch tweet. It was released right before the holiday break --- the team expected to collect data and possibly shut it down afterward. Instead, it went viral immediately.

The team had initially been building specialized "super assistant" tools. The decisive insight was to ship a dead-simple chat interface --- a text box, a chat history, and a Send button. As one analysis put it: "GPT-3 and ChatGPT had the same brain. Only one had a front door people wanted to walk through."

### Key People

- **John Schulman** (OpenAI co-founder): Led the reinforcement learning team and co-led post-training. Inventor of PPO, the algorithm underpinning RLHF. Called the "architect" of ChatGPT by UC Berkeley.
- **Barret Zoph**: Joined right before ChatGPT and helped build the post-training team from scratch with Schulman. Later became VP of Post-Training.
- **Liam Fedus**: OpenAI scientist who worked directly on ChatGPT's training.
- **Sandhini Agarwal**: Policy lead who shaped the safety guardrails.
- **Jan Leike**: Led OpenAI's alignment team.
- **Nick Turley**: Product lead who drove the decision to ship a simple chat interface.
- **Mira Murati**: CTO who oversaw ChatGPT, DALL-E, Codex, and Sora.

## The Name

The product was going to launch as **"Chat with GPT-3.5."** The night before launch, Nick Turley and the team had a late-night decision to simplify. Turley revealed on the OpenAI podcast (July 1, 2025): **"It was going to be Chat with GPT-3.5, and we had a late-night decision to simplify. We realized that that would be hard to pronounce and came up with a great name instead."**

No market research. Pure intuition. The name turned out to be extraordinarily effective for global virality --- easy to pronounce across languages and culturally neutral.

## The Board Didn't Know

Former board member Helen Toner revealed on The TED AI Show (May 2024): **"When ChatGPT came out in November 2022, the board was not informed in advance about that. We learned about ChatGPT on Twitter."**

This detail became a key grievance in the board dynamics that led to Sam Altman's firing in November 2023.

## The Team's Shock

Jan Leike (alignment team lead): **"I would love to understand better what's driving all of this --- what's driving the virality. Like, honestly, we don't understand. We don't know."**

Sam Altman's launch tweet was deliberately understated: **"today we launched ChatGPT. try talking with it here."** Three days later: **"ChatGPT launched on wednesday. today it crossed 1 million users!"**

Altman later told the NYT's Hard Fork podcast: **"ChatGPT is a horrible product. It was really not designed to be used."** He described it as "version 0.7" and said he **"would have expected maybe one order of magnitude less of everything."** CTO Mira Murati echoed: **"This was definitely surprising."**

In the early days, **TikTok comments became a primary user research channel** for the team, providing real-time feedback that shaped product decisions.

Growth: 1 million users in 5 days. 57 million by end of December. 100 million monthly active users by January 2023 --- the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

## Eye-Watering Compute Costs

Sam Altman tweeted (December 5, 2022): **"we will have to monetize it somehow at some point; the compute costs are eye-watering."** SemiAnalysis estimated OpenAI was burning approximately **$700K/day** to run ChatGPT.

OpenAI's 2022 financials (from Fortune, citing internal documents): under $30 million revenue against $544.5 million in projected expenses --- a net loss of over half a billion dollars.

The **$20/month ChatGPT Plus** price (launched February 1, 2023) was chosen via a Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter survey posted as a Google Form in their Discord community. It was primarily **demand control** --- a filter to separate serious users from casual ones, not a revenue optimization exercise. The price point became so influential that competitors copied it.

## Microsoft's Backstory

The Microsoft-OpenAI relationship predates ChatGPT. In 2019, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent a four-page email to CEO Satya Nadella and Bill Gates with the subject "thoughts on OpenAI," warning: **"As I dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training, I got very, very worried."** He stated: **"We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of ML scale."** Nadella replied: **"This is why I want us to do this."** Microsoft invested $1 billion that year.

ChatGPT's viral success accelerated the next investment. On **January 23, 2023** --- less than two months after launch --- Microsoft announced ~$10 billion more, bringing total investment to ~$13 billion.

The profit-sharing structure (from Fortune's internal documents): Microsoft receives 75% of profits until recovering its $13 billion, drops to 49% until it recoups $92 billion. Other investors and employees receive 49% until earning $150 billion collectively.

## The Altman Firing

ChatGPT's explosive success created an irreconcilable tension between commercialization speed and safety caution, culminating in the most dramatic episode in AI industry history.

**Ilya Sutskever planned it for over a year.** In his nearly 10-hour deposition (October 1, 2025, Musk v. OpenAI lawsuit), when asked how long he'd been considering firing Altman, Sutskever answered: **"At least a year."** He had been waiting for board dynamics where **"the majority of the board is not obviously friendly with Sam."**

At the heart of the ouster was a **52-page memo** prepared at board member Adam D'Angelo's request. Sutskever's opening line: **"Sam exhibits a consistent pattern of lying, undermining his execs, and pitting his execs against one another."** He sent the memo using a disappearing email service.

OpenAI's first **DevDay** (November 6, 2023) was a trigger --- Sutskever and allies viewed the announcements (custom GPTs, GPT Store, GPT-4 Turbo) as further evidence of reckless commercialization.

On **November 17, 2023**, the board fired Altman. Helen Toner later said: **"Sam didn't inform the board that he owned the OpenAI startup fund, even though he constantly was claiming to be an independent board member with no financial interest in the company."**

After nearly all of OpenAI's 770 employees threatened to resign, the board reversed its decision on **November 22**. Sutskever himself signed the employee letter. After firing Altman, some board members had briefly explored **merging OpenAI with Anthropic**.

## Ilya Sutskever's Arc

In **September 2022** --- two months before ChatGPT launched --- at an OpenAI off-site, Sutskever placed a wooden effigy representing an aligned AI that turned out to be deceitful. He explained that OpenAI had a duty to destroy it, then **doused it in lighter fluid and set it on fire.**

ChatGPT "accidentally derailed Sutskever's plans by unleashing a funding gold rush that the safety-minded Sutskever could no longer control." He genuinely believed Altman was putting the world at risk --- that Sam's commercial instincts were fundamentally incompatible with the caution required when building superintelligence.

After leaving OpenAI in May 2024, Sutskever co-founded **Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)** in June 2024, focused exclusively on the mission he felt OpenAI had abandoned.

## The Competitive Shockwave

### Google: "Code Red"

In December 2022, Sundar Pichai declared a companywide **"code red,"** calling ChatGPT an existential threat to Google Search. Teams across research, Trust and Safety, and other departments were reassigned. Google had the underlying technology (LaMDA/Bard) but had been reluctant to release it due to accuracy and safety concerns. A former employee later described how the "code red" meeting led executives to take "shortcuts" in the Gemini AI launch.

### Anthropic: The Company That Held Back

Anthropic had actually finished training its first version of Claude in **summer 2022** --- months before ChatGPT launched. But the company chose not to release it, citing safety concerns and a desire to avoid "stoking the flames of AI hype." Dario Amodei later told Time Magazine: **"I suspect it was the right thing to do."** Anthropic released Claude publicly in July 2023.

Helen Toner's controversial October 2023 paper praised Anthropic's cautious approach while criticizing OpenAI's --- a paper that became one of the catalysts for Altman's firing.

### Meta: The Open-Source Pivot

Mark Zuckerberg made AI a top priority inside Meta in response to ChatGPT. Meta released LLaMA in February 2023, initially for researchers only. After it leaked online and caught on with developers, Zuckerberg made the pivotal decision to release LLaMA 2 as fully open source in July 2023. The open-source approach became Meta's distinctive competitive positioning.
